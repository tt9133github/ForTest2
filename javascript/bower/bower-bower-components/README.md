# JavaScript Project with `bower_components` only

This project is an example of a JavaScript project that uses Bower to manage its dependencies. The dependencies are installed in `bower_components`.

`bower_components` at the root directory declares the dependencies:
- dojo: 1.1.1rc2

Total number of dependencies:
- 1 transitive dependencies.
- 6 vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerable Call Chain
This project does not have a vulnerable call chain. If you would like to test this feature, feel free to create a vulnerable call chain by modifying index.js (and adding the necessary dependencies in `bower.json`) and send us a PR.

#### What's next?
By running the security scanner of your choice against `bower-bower-components` project, you should get results that are coherent with the details above if the tool supports scanning of projects with only `bower_components` containing JavaScript dependencies.
